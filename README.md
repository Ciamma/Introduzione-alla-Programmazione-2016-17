Welcome to Introduction to Programming, where I took my first steps into the world of programming.

The course, taught by Professor Pellacini, allowed me to learn the basics of Python programming (version 3 had just come out). 

Unfortunately, I do not have with me all the homework I did that year. 

If you are curious, you can try the individual programs or check for correctness through tests (as the professor did at that time).
